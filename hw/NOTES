It's almost impossible for me to find a proper watch for data 
collection, since I am too chicken to spend money on them because I have 
no cash.

So I've been spending my morning looking at chips and thinking about how 
to design a wearable smart watch, or which features I would need.

I had a list of important things, but here's an example:
  - MT2523 MCU
  - 4GB SD Module integrated?
  - Vibration simple: wire motor to correct pins, set flag in software
  - Keypad: extent of integration?
  - BTLE needed?
  - Battery
  - HR Monitor I2C or SPI connection
  - LCM Modules integrated?
  - uUSB connector

I would use the chip's flash to load an embedded linux OS into memory 
and go from there. Once linux is loaded it's actually not that hard to 
make it work.

Maybe I should develop the software to justify buying a dev board for 
debugging, and then by the grace of God I'll be able to somehow make a 
PCB layout which works for me?

Required software will be quite simple:
  - Keypad macro to flag begin sampling
  - Keypad macro to flag awake or trying to sleep
  - Collect sample every 5 seconds when sampling activated
  - Guess time of sleep every 60 seconds when both flags set
  - Keep an average until minute 19 after average sleep guess
  - Vibrate at minute 20 until keypad stops
  - Keypad Macro to input how many seconds it took to fall asleep
  - Modify data on-disk to transform "trying to sleep" into "most likely asleep"
    - Run training on device OR
    - Sync data to phone and train there

It's really not that many steps when u think about it. A lot is taken 
care of by the MCU, like vibration driver, clock, computing, it has a 
bunch of pins... 6 consoles! This is kind of like a state machine.

Let's iron out some functions we will need:
```
sampling = False
trying_sleep = False
set_seconds_to_sleep = None
last_action_key = None

callback = None
buffer = []

def process_keypad(key):
  if key == ENTER:
    if callback is not None:
      callback(buffer)
      buffer = []

    last_action_key = None

  elif last_action_key is None:
    last_action_key = key   

  if set_seconds_to_sleep is not None && last_action_key is 7:
    if callback is None:
      callback = (edit_samples_on_disk(set_seconds_to_sleep, **kwargs))
    buffer += key

  switch(key):
    ...

guesses = []
waiting_guess = 0
when sampling:
  sample = [time.now, get_HR_data(), trying_sleep]
  write_to_disk(filename=session_start_time, sample)
  if waiting_guess is 12:
    guesses += guess_sleep_time(session_start_time)
    if time.now - average(guesses) >= 20 * 60:
      vibrate_until_kill()
      set_seconds_to_sleep = session_start_time
      train_with_difference()
    waiting_guess = 0

  waiting_guess += 5
  wait(5)
```

EDIT: It might be powerful to have the trying to sleep flag be an input 
feature, because it is not the label (the corrected version is the 
label)

The above is pseudocode for a fully operational system. We still need to 
collect data and train a model before we can use the above.

Even if the watch is only accurate to 2-3 minutes, it will be more than 
worth my efforts.

============================================================================

UPDATE for the watch, we are making some progress!

Now, I have an OK idea of the steps I need to take to develop an electronic product:
 1. Find a use case
 2. List out required active components
 3. Create block diagram showing connections
 4. Download EDA/PCB files for parts
 5. Make schematic
 6. Make Gerber from schematic
 7. Test outputs
 8. Order custom PCB
 9. Test PCB, Program, Debug
 10. Design an enclosure
 11. 3D print enclosure
 12. Verify PCB/enclosure dynamic

After that, I don't really need to pay attention because my goal is not mass production.

I want to do designer lifestyle electronics.

In this case, I will KISS for the "watch" (really a wristband with sensors, 2 buttons and ML firmware).

So, that brings us to our current modifications in terms of which parts to use, what is useful and what isn't.

I had to reluctantly let go of the Mediatek MCU platform. Even though it does provide everything out of the box, I couldn't find proper EDA or 
other open-source schematic symbols or footprints when it came to drawing a schematic for that system. I ended up doing some more research and 
it turns out that the manufacturer who makes the heart-rate sensor also makes MCU's with the same ARM Cortex-M4 core as the MT2523.

Most of the components I will be using will come from Maxim Integrated if possible, because they always provide schematic symbols, footprints 
and 3d models which helps a lot for designing.

==========================================

SO, when taking into account all the physical aspects of making this device, I came to the conclusion that I need to elevate the HR sensor off of the main PCB. This is 
because it needs to be almost directly into contact with my skin to work properly (especially given the integrated solution I'm using which can be seen as lower quality 
than average).

I was really not down to have to mess with flex cable designs, which are very common in the smart watch market for connecting the distant HR sensor. Turns out I can 
probably just use 2 PCBs: a main one and one dedicated to the HR sensor.

The layers of the design I'm imagining are as follows:
 - Top half of the frame, with part of it being a glass or acrylic window peering into a small enclosure
   ====-----=========
       |_ _|
 - The HR sensor is housed into the enclosure and exposes its pins through a female header
 - The main PCB layer which is connected to the HR sensor through its own female header and a M-M set of cables (like SATA but smaller)
 - On the other side of the PCB is where the battery and keypad modules stand
 - Bottom half of the frame, with no window but a small part of the edge taken off to show the keypad module

The main technical challenge here is the glass and how to insert the HR sensor and fasten it properly.

I see all the SW designs employing a protruded enclosure to really give leeway to the sensor to get accurate measurements.

UPDATE: I will make a PCB for the HR sensor that is flush with it and glue its edges to the enclosure. The back (bottom) of the PCB will show a connector. No more 
glass, not useful. Maybe if I run into problems with the sensor getting scratched I'll print a new top part and glue a slim piece of glass over it. Now I have the 
chance to practice a bit of schematic and PCB gerber gen!
